<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
  The Procedural Knowledge Ontology (PKO) addresses the Procedural Knowledge (PK) domain, and models procedures, their executions, and related resources and agents.
  It reuses existing ontologies, including [P-Plan](http://purl.org/net/p-plan#), which models plans and their steps; [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), for provenance tracking; [D-CAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), for modelling metadata about resources.
  
  For designing the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305). 
  The resources associated with the requirements specification are available in the [requirements folder](https://github.com/perks-project/pk-ontology/tree/master/requirements).

  The intended use of terms is detailed in the [diagram](https://github.com/perks-project/pk-ontology/blob/master/ontology/pko.png), which uses the [Chowlk notation]( https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation).</span>
