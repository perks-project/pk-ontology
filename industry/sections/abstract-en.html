<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
  Industry module of the Procedural Knowledge Ontology (PKO).
  
  For designing the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305). 
  The resources associated with the requirements specification are available in the [requirements folder](https://github.com/perks-project/pk-ontology/tree/master/requirements).

  The intended use of terms is detailed in the [diagram](https://github.com/perks-project/pk-ontology/blob/master/ontology/pko-ind.png), which uses the [Chowlk notation]( https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation).</span>
